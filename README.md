## Portfolio Projects
This repository contains a collection of side projects, course assignments, and other interesting things I have been working on. 

For a full overview of my background, see my [CV](CV.pdf). It references a handful of projects here with additional context.

Each directory represents a separate piece of work. Each directory contains a PDF describing that piece of work. Each directory will also include source code when it is appropriate to share (sharing assignment source code is often not allowed as future course iterations re-use tasks).
